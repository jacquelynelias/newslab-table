#Newslab Open Records Compliance Table
##Overview

Jackie could not complete because the Georgia News Lab students in Ken's class are still gathering/updating data. When they finish, the relevant file is `data/data.csv` - they should edit that and then everything else should auto-adjust.

Then push files to S3, ajcnewsapps/2018/georgia-news-lab-table and then add to Methode. Then go update the same file in the [viz repo](https://bitbucket.org/ajcnewsapp/georgia-news-lab-viz/src/master/data/data.csv)/s3 bucket
